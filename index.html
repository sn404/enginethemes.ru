<p>Divi is an exceptional theme in many ways. I have seen few themes that are as multifaceted as Divi which makes it a great theme for pretty much any purpose. Coupled with its great graphics and a powerful page builder it certainly is a worthy contender for title of best multipurpose theme.</p>

<p>Great graphics, multi purpose orientation and a powerful page builder, this in and of itself is a potent combination. But having used Divi on a test site, I can tell you that it is certainly a theme that be used by a non developer to create a functional and elegant website with the least amount of effort. And personally I believe that the best themes should always be capable of lending voice to the creative intent of any online entrepreneur without distinguishing those who can and can not code.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s have a closer inspection of Divi, before heaping further praise.</p>
